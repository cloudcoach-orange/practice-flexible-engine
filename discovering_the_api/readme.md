# LAB: discover the API of Flexible Engine

This lab will help you to use various API of Flexible Engine with various tools available for you. You can do it on your local machine or creating a ECS with an EIP and connect to do it.
You can clone this repository or download the resources as zip.


## Set environment variables
First you need to set variable in configuration file "setenv.sh", you can find all the information in my credential (top right on the Flexible Engine Console).

You need at least to change the value of:
- OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID (line 8)
- OS_PROJECT_ID (line 9)
- OS_PROJECT_NAME (line 10)
- OS_USERNAME (line 16).
- S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID (line 18)
- S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (line 19)  

If you're not doing on eu-west-0, you also need to change:
- OS_AUTH_URL (line 5)
- OS_REGION_NAME (line 13)


Then you should source the parameters and enter your API password
```shell
$ source setenv.sh
Please enter your OpenStack Password:
***********
$
```

## Openstackcli
> you need to install openstackcli for this part.
> if you are using linux, juste type "sudo apt install python3-openstackclient"
> overwise follow openstack documentation https://docs.openstack.org/newton/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html

OpenStackClient (aka OSC) is a command-line client for OpenStack that brings the command together in a single shell with a uniform command structure.

Query all the image of the plateform
```shell
$ openstack image list
```

Create a router/VPC
```shell
$ openstack router create <your_router_name>
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Field                   |
+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| admin_state_up          | UP    
.....
```

List all router
```shell
$ openstack router list
+--------------------------------------+--------------------+--------+-------+----------------------------------+
| ID                                   | Name               | Status | State | Project                          |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------+--------+-------+----------------------------------+
| 1d87c119-XXX-4bXXX-8496-3803XXXX886b | <your_router_name> | ACTIVE | UP    | 00000000cxxxxxxxxxxx3e1e7cdd7c28 |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------+--------+-------+----------------------------------+
```

Delete router
```shell
$ openstack router delete <your_router_name>
```

Openstackcli is an easy way to use the API but having some issue to create a lot of resources as one call means one resource.
list of all the command available: https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-list.html (FE don't support all of them)

## Curl
It's possible to use API without abstraction tools. To try them, there is few script in folder curl. All script look the same:
- Action and target services as the name file.
- First lines of script are variables for target services, there is few change depending of action and service.
- In the middle, there is the token request as it's mandatory to use api.
- Last line is the wanted api of the script.

Get the image list with script **get_image.sh**
```shell
$ bash curl/get_image.sh
```
as you can see with raw usage of API and no tools, the output is hard to read.


Create an EIP
```shell
$ bash curl/create_eip.sh
```

Get a list of all the eip, it should be easier to read because you have less elements.
```shell
$ bash curl/get_eip.sh
```

Delete the eip, The script will ask for the eip id, copy/past id from the last output (be careful of empty space and quote)
```shell
$ bash curl/delete_eip.sh
Please enter the eip id to delete:
91216f81-xxxx-aaaa-bbbb-f668a4c84ce3
$
```

The usage of the API like that are more time consuming but allow you to use and integrate it with anything able to use web services.

## Terraform
> you need to install terraform for this part.
> https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html

### with openstack provider
> Documentation of terraform openstack provider https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html

Go to terraform-os folder and edit configuration file **config.tf**. Change value of variable **keypair** with the name of an existing keypair.
```shell
vi /terraform-os/config.tf
```

Then go inside the folder to init environment of terraform:
```shell
$ cd /terraform-os
$ terraform init
```

Plan and/or apply to see change and deploy the infrastructure. Before any change, terraform will ask for confirmation before changing, but you can by-pass this by adding "-auto-approve"
```shell
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
```

When infrastructure is ready, you can edit file to change name of a resource or an IP or anything. After each change you need to reapply, it will show you the change : edition, deletion, deletion with re-creation, etc.
```shell
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
```

When you've finished, delete all the resources
```shell
$ terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

### with flexibleegine provider
> Documentation of terraform flexible engine provider https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/flexibleengine/index.html

Go to terraform-fe folder and edit configuration file **config.tf**. Change value of variable **keypair** with the name of an existing keypair.
```shell
vi /terraform-fe/config.tf
```

Then go inside the folder to init environment of terraform:
```shell
$ cd /terraform-fe
$ terraform init
```

Plan and/or apply to see change and deploy the infrastructure. Before any change, terraform will ask for confirmation before changing, but you can by-pass this by adding "-auto-approve"
```shell
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
```
> the result is the same as Openstack, but the resource name are different and some api were different:
> floating IP is change by EIP (floating IP + bandiwidth)
> router is change by VPC (router with CIDR parameter)

When infrastructure is ready, you can edit file to change name of a resource or an IP or anything. After each change you need to reapply, it will show you the change : edition, deletion, deletion with re-creation, etc.
```shell
$ terraform apply -auto-approve
```

When you've finished, delete all the resources
```shell
$ terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## Use Object Storage API with s3cmd
> S3cmd is a free command line tool and client for uploading, retrieving and managing data in cloud storage service providers that use the S3 protocol.
> you can get s3cmd for linux repository or from https://s3tools.org/s3cmd
> you need to have S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID and S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in the setenv file (and source it)

Copy the file .s3cfg at the root of your user, or add "-c s3cmd/.s3cfg" at the end of each command.

List and show information of bucket
```shell
$ s3cmd ls
$ s3cmd ls -c s3cmd/.s3cfg
$ s3cmd info s3://<name_of_bucket>
```

Then create a bucket, upload a local file, delete a file &  the bucket.
```shell
$ s3cmd mb s3://<your_bucket_name>
$ s3cmd put README.md s3://<new_bucket_name>
$ s3cmd ls s3://<your_bucket_name>
$ s3cmd rm s3://<your_bucket_name>/readme.md
$ s3cmd rb s3://<your_bucket_name>
```

You can find all the usage at https://s3tools.org/usage
